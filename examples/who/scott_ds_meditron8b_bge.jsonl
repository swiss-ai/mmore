    "answer": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nYou will have to answer a question. You can use or not the following context to answer the question.\n\nContext:\n[1] immunodeficiency (CD4 count: <50 cells/mm3).4 An exception is made for TB meningitis, when starting ART after\neight weeks of initiating anti-TB treatment is recommended. Following the operational research, WHO updated\nits guidelines to recommend the initiation of ART within two weeks for all HIV-positive TB patients (adults and\nchildren), except those with TB meningitis. This update has not yet been introduced in Armenia.\nFor HIV-associated TB patients with drug-susceptible TB, the duration of anti-TB treatment is usually extended\nfrom six to eight months.\nHowever, in interviews, most HIV and TB physicians did not mention in some cases ART can start earlier than two\nweeks after initiation of anti-TB treatment (i.e. for patients with a CD4 count of <50 cells/mm3 and HIV patients\nwith drug-resistant TB), despite both WHO and national HIV treatment guidelines emphasizing this. The rationale\nfor this recommendation was that the risk of death for patients with severe immunosuppression outweighs the\nrisk of complications from immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome. Physicians preferred to observe all\nHIV-infected TB patients on anti-TB treatment for at least two weeks before prescribing ART.\n4 This is done for several reasons: to simplify patient management; avoid ART and anti-TB drug interactions and overlapping toxicities; limit\nthe risk of immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome; minimize confusion about what drugs to take, when, and for which disease; and\nincrease adherence.\n32\nHIV physician: According to our protocol, a patient receives at least two weeks of anti-TB\ntreatment, and then we start ART, after two to eight weeks. Usually, we do not wait until eight\nweeks. Sometimes, we start [ART] at week six or seven because of poor tolerance to anti-TB drugs.\nIf a patient has other infections that we have not yet diagnosed, ART initiation can be slightly\ndelayed. On average, we are in the two-week window. Unless it's TB meningitis, then we should\nstart ART after eight weeks.\nInitiation of TB and HIV treatment in an inpatient setting\nART-naive HIV-coinfected TB patients are typically hospitalized for inpatient care in NPC, where HIV treatment is\ninitiated with the support of an HIV physician who visits the facility at least twice a week.\n\n[2] recurrent pneumonia, persistent diarrhoea, new prolonged fever, weight loss) during\nTB treatment needs to be assessed by the district doctor/medical officer. These\npatients usually benefit from starting ART, while still on TB treatment.\n43\n7.3\nSpecial adherence considerations for TB-HIV patients\nPatients who start ART should be thoroughly briefed beforehand on the need to\nadhere to the treatment plan. A past history of non-adherence to TB treatment\ncan mean that the patient may also have difficulties adhering to ART. It is\nimportant to explore possible barriers to adherence. It may be better to defer ART\nuntil these issues can be resolved.\n7.4\nFill out the TB Treatment Card and the HIV Care/ART Card\nThe HIV Care/ART Card should be updated when the patient starts ART, as\ndescribed in the IMAI Basic Clinical Course. In addition, the TB Treatment Card\nneeds to be updated with the date ART is started, the regimen used and the\nunique ART number that is on the front of the HIV Care/ART Card. This will allow\nthis record to be found in the file cabinet, the ART Register, or in the national\ndatabase if one exists.\n44\nAssume that the CD4 count is not available in the following cases:\nCase\nTreatment Plan\nA patient in HIV care who was in clinical stage 2\nduring his last visit and is on cotrimoxazole\nprophylaxis, develops cough and fever.

There is\nalso a need for studies that compare the effect of starting ART within 2 weeks and from\n2 weeks but within 8 weeks of TB treatment. More research is also needed into the\noptimal timing of initiation of ART in adults and children with TB meningitis.\n4.3.6 Diagnosis and treatment of recent HIV infection\nRecent HIV infection is defined as the period up to 6 months following HIV acquisition,\nduring which specific anti-HIV antibodies become detectable by serological tests\n(seroconversion) and when the viral load steady state (set point) and viral reservoirs are\nusually established (192-194). During the first weeks of this phase, people recently\ninfected with HIV can (but will not always) develop an acute clinical syndrome associated\nwith the initial and rapid burst of viraemia characterized by the presence of some\nself-limited clinical signs and symptoms - such as fever, myalgia, pharyngitis and rash -\nthat usually subside after 2-4 weeks (195). During this early stage of HIV infection, the\nimmune system also starts to get damaged and the frequently unsuspecting infected\nperson may be most infectious to others (196-198).\nWith the increasing availability of more accurate diagnostic testing, more effective drug\nregimens and better knowledge of the dynamics of HIV transmission and viral reservoirs,\nearly diagnosis during recent HIV infection has been viewed as an opportunity for treatment\nand prevention interventions, with a potentially important public health impact (11).\n<attachment>\n<attachment>\n<attachment>\n<attachment>\n<attachment>\n96\nConsolidated guidelines on the use of antiretroviral drugs for treating and preventing HIV infection<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nMy 8yr old female patient was recently diagnosed with TB and TB meningitis.

This is because TB meningitis is an immune-mediated complication of TB that can be exacerbated by the initiation of ART.
