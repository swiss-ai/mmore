The dosage should be adjusted according to the patient's renal function. The recommended dose for quinine in patients with severe malaria is 10 mg/kg of body weight every 8 hours, but this dose may need to be adjusted in patients with acute kidney injury. It is recommended to consult a specialist or a drug reference guide for specific dosage adjustments in this patient population.",
