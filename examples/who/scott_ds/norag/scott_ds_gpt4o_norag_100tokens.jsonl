    "answer": "In the scenario you described, where a neonate is not breathing within one minute after birth and has a heart rate of 30-40 beats per minute, both positive pressure ventilation (PPV) and chest compressions are indicated. According to neonatal resuscitation guidelines, if a neonate's heart rate is below 60 beats per minute after 30 seconds of effective positive pressure ventilation, chest compressions should be started in addition to continuing ventilation. In this situation, the heart rate is significantly",
    "input": "When two providers are resuscitating a neonate who isn't breathing within one minute after birth and the heartrate is 30-40 beats per minute should we assist ventilation and do chest compressions or just ventilate?",
