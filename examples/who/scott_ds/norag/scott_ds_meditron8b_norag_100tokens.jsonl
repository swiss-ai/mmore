However, patients with acute kidney injury (AKI) may require dose adjustments to ensure optimal efficacy and minimize toxicity.\n\n### Factors to Consider:\n\n*   **Kidney Function:** Quinine is primarily excreted by the kidneys. In patients with AKI, the kidneys' ability to clear the drug is impaired, leading to potential accumulation and toxicity.\n",

This is because starting ART early can help to reduce the risk of HIV transmission to others, and it can also help to improve the patient's immune system and overall health. It is important to work closely with a healthcare provider to ensure that the patient is receiving the best possible care and to monitor for any potential side effects of",
