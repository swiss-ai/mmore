    "context": "[1]  This should be followed by a full dose of\neffective ACT orally. Two classes of medicine are available for\nparenteral treatment of severe malaria: artemisinin derivatives\n(artesunate or artemether) and the cinchona alkaloids (quinine\nand quinidine). Parenteral artesunate is the treatment of choice\nfor all severe malaria. The largest randomized clinical trials ever\nconducted on severe falciparum malaria showed a substantial\nreduction in mortality with intravenous or intramuscular\nartesunate as compared with parenteral quinine. The reduction\nin mortality was not associated with an increase in neurological\nsequelae in artesunate-treated survivors. Furthermore,\nartesunate is simpler and safer to use.\nPre-referral treatment options\nSee recommendation.\nAdjustment of parenteral dosing in renal failure or hepatic\ndysfunction\nThe dosage of artemisinin derivatives does not have to be\nadjusted for patients with vital organ dysfunction. However\nquinine accumulates in severe vital organ dysfunction. If a\npatient with severe malaria has persisting acute kidney injury or\nthere is no clinical improvement by 48 h, the dose of quinine\nshould be reduced by one third, to 10 mg salt/kg bw every 12 h.\nDosage adjustments are not necessary if patients are receiving\neither haemodialysis or haemofiltration.\nFollow-on treatment\nThe current recommendation of experts is to give parenteral\nantimalarial drugs for the treatment of severe malaria for a\nminimum of 24 h once started (irrespective of the patient's\nability to tolerate oral medication earlier) or until the patient can\ntolerate oral medication, before giving the oral follow-up\ntreatment.\nAfter initial parenteral treatment, once the patient can tolerate\noral therapy, it is essential to continue and complete treatment\nwith an effective oral antimalarial drug by giving a full course of\neffective ACT (artesunate + amodiaquine, artemether +\nlumefantrine or dihydroartemisinin + piperaquine). If the patient\npresented initially with impaired consciousness, ACTs containing\nmefloquine should be avoided because of an increased incidence\nof neuropsychiatric complications.",
    "answer": "In the case of a patient with severe malaria and acute kidney injury where artesunate is not available, you will need to adjust the dosage of quinine. Since quinine accumulates in cases of severe vital organ dysfunction, it is recommended to reduce the dose by one third if there is persisting acute kidney injury or no clinical improvement within 48 hours. Therefore, the adjusted dose for quinine should be 10 mg salt/kg body weight every 12 hours. Keep monitoring the patient's condition closely to ensure appropriate management.",
    "input": "I am treating a patient with severe malaria who has an acute kidney injury due to their disease severity. We do not have artesunate in stock and we cant do dialysis here, we only have quinine in a parenteral solution. How should I adjust the dosage for Quinine in this patient?"

In addition, the TB Treatment Card\nneeds to be updated with the date ART is started, the regimen used and the\nunique ART number that is on the front of the HIV Care/ART Card.

    "answer": "It is generally recommended to start antiretroviral therapy (ART) as soon as possible in patients diagnosed with both TB and HIV, especially when they have a serious condition like TB meningitis. However, the timing should be carefully considered due to the risk of immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS), which can occur when ART is initiated in the presence of active TB infection.\n\nIn this specific case, since the patient was recently diagnosed with TB and TB meningitis and has shown improvement after 3 weeks of TB treatment, it would be advisable to consult with a specialist or refer to the latest guidelines and protocols for initiating ART in children with TB meningitis. In general, ART is often started within 2-8 weeks after the initiation of TB treatment, but the decision should take into account the patient's clinical condition and potential IRIS risk.\n\nIt is also important to ensure that the patient, and caregivers, are thoroughly briefed on the importance of adherence to both TB and ART treatments to maximize the effectiveness and reduce the risk of complications.",
