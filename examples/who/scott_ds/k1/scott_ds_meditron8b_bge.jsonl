    "answer": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nYou will have to answer a question. You can use or not the following context to answer the question.\n\nContext:\n[1]  This should be followed by a full dose of\neffective ACT orally. Two classes of medicine are available for\nparenteral treatment of severe malaria: artemisinin derivatives\n(artesunate or artemether) and the cinchona alkaloids (quinine\nand quinidine). Parenteral artesunate is the treatment of choice\nfor all severe malaria. The largest randomized clinical trials ever\nconducted on severe falciparum malaria showed a substantial\nreduction in mortality with intravenous or intramuscular\nartesunate as compared with parenteral quinine. The reduction\nin mortality was not associated with an increase in neurological\nsequelae in artesunate-treated survivors. Furthermore,\nartesunate is simpler and safer to use.\nPre-referral treatment options\nSee recommendation.\nAdjustment of parenteral dosing in renal failure or hepatic\ndysfunction\nThe dosage of artemisinin derivatives does not have to be\nadjusted for patients with vital organ dysfunction. However\nquinine accumulates in severe vital organ dysfunction. If a\npatient with severe malaria has persisting acute kidney injury or\nthere is no clinical improvement by 48 h, the dose of quinine\nshould be reduced by one third, to 10 mg salt/kg bw every 12 h.\nDosage adjustments are not necessary if patients are receiving\neither haemodialysis or haemofiltration.\nFollow-on treatment\nThe current recommendation of experts is to give parenteral\nantimalarial drugs for the treatment of severe malaria for a\nminimum of 24 h once started (irrespective of the patient's\nability to tolerate oral medication earlier) or until the patient can\ntolerate oral medication, before giving the oral follow-up\ntreatment.\nAfter initial parenteral treatment, once the patient can tolerate\noral therapy, it is essential to continue and complete treatment\nwith an effective oral antimalarial drug by giving a full course of\neffective ACT (artesunate + amodiaquine, artemether +\nlumefantrine or dihydroartemisinin + piperaquine). If the patient\npresented initially with impaired consciousness, ACTs containing\nmefloquine should be avoided because of an increased incidence\nof neuropsychiatric complications.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nI am treating a patient with severe malaria who has an acute kidney injury due to their disease severity.
