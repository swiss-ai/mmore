You can use or not the following context to answer the question.\n\nContext:\n[1] started with air.\n*\nFor newborns who continue to have a heart rate of less than 60 beats per\nminute after 30 seconds of adequate ventilation with air, progressively higher\nconcentrations of oxygen should be considered. However, if oxygen is not\navailable, ventilation should be continued with air.\n*\nIf available, and if there is more than one health worker performing\nnewborn resuscitation, pulse oximetry should be used to determine the need\nfor supplemental oxygen and to monitor the needed concentration of\noxygen.\nS-172\nImmediate newborn conditions or problems\nEvaluate Resuscitation Efforts\n*\nVentilate for one minute; then stop and quickly:\n-\nassess if the newborn is breathing spontaneously; and\n-\nrapidly measure the heart rate (normal is more than 100 beats per\nminute) by:\n-\nfeeling the umbilical cord pulse;\n-\nOR listening to the heartbeat with a stethoscope.\nCirculation: Chest Compressions\n*\nDecide if chest compressions are needed:\n-\nWhen a second skilled provider is present, and the neonate has a\nheart rate of less than 60 beats per minute after one minute of\npositive pressure ventilation, consider chest compressions in\naddition to positive pressure ventilation (see WHO, Guidelines\non Basic Newborn Resuscitation, 2012).\nNote: In newly born babies who do not start breathing within one minute\nafter birth, priority should be given to providing adequate ventilation\nrather than to performing chest compressions.\nContinue or Stop Resuscitation\n*\nIf breathing is normal (30-60 breaths per minute) and there is no\nindrawing of the chest and no grunting for one minute, no further\nresuscitation is needed. Proceed with initial care of the newborn (page\nC-107).\n*\nIf the newborn is not breathing, or the breathing is weak, continue\nventilating until spontaneous breathing begins.\n*\nIf the newborn starts crying, stop ventilating and continue to observe\nbreathing for five minutes after crying stops:\n-\nIf breathing is normal (30-60 breaths per minute) and there is no\nindrawing of the chest and no grunting for one minute, no\nfurther resuscitation is needed. Proceed with initial care of the\nnewborn (page C-107).\n\n\n[2] After 30 seconds of ventilation with bag\nand mask reassess the baby's breathing\nand heart rate and take appropriate ac-\ntion.\nIf after ventilation with bag and mask, the\ninfant remains not breathing, or gasping,\nor grunting or heart rate is less than 100\nbeats per min but more than 60 beats per\nmin, or central cyanosis (despite admini-\nstration of supplementary oxygen), con-\ntinue ventilation with bag and mask or\nconsider the possibility of endotracheal\nintubation if skilled staff is present.\nChest compressions are an indicated for a heart rate is less than 60 beats per min despite ade-\nquate ventilation for 30 seconds.\n2005 American Heart Association Guidelines for Cardiopulmonary\nResuscitation and Emergency Cardiovascular Care, Part 13: Neonatal Resuscitation Guide-\nlines.
