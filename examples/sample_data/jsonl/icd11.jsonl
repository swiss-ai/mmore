The infection usually follows trauma, such as a puncture from a splinter of wood and tends to affect exposed sites such as the feet and ankles. Chromoblastomycosis manifests initially as a warty papule which slowly enlarges to form a hypertrophic, warty plaque. Eventually, after months or many years, large hyperkeratotic masses may form, sometimes with secondary ulceration.\n                "}

It shows marked geographic differences, with highest incidence rates in Southern China. In some endemic areas, the incidence has declined by about 30% over the past two decades, suggesting that environmental or lifestyle factors may play a major role and that the disease is, to some extent, preventable. Nasopharyngeal carcinoma shows a very strong association with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection, irrespective of the ethnic origin of the patients. This association has pioneered a new paradigm of utilizing viral serological tests for the diagnosis of cancer and for screening in high-risk populations. Nasopharyngeal carcinoma is generally responsive to radiation therapy, and the clinical outcome has greatly improved over the years, due to refinements in staging and to improved therapy protocols. The unusual and often deceptive histological features of nasopharyngeal carcinoma have generated controversies over the nature of the tumour and still pose a challenge to surgical pathologists.

It starts as a small translucent nodule which will frequently necrose and ulcerate as it enlarges. Telangiectatic blood vessels can often be detected just under the tumour surface. A minority may be pigmented and give rise to difficulty in distinguishing them from melanoma.\n                "}

It may infiltrate widely and deeply before it becomes clinically obvious. It typically starts as a pale, poorly-defined indurated plaque which may not come to medical attention until it starts to bleed and crust.\n                "}

A fine pearly border can usually be seen on careful inspection. They occur most frequently on the trunk.\n                "}
