## Overview

The **Indexer API** allows users to **upload, update, download, delete, and index documents** into a Milvus vector database for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and search applications.

Uploads are **asynchronous**: the upload endpoints validate the request, queue a background job, and return `202 Accepted` with a `jobId` immediately. Processing and indexing then run in the background, one job per GPU. Clients track progress with the job status endpoints (snapshot or SSE stream).

## ⚙️ Backend server setup

### Setup Instructions

#### 1. Configure the server

The server reads everything from the YAML file passed with `--config-file` (a
`RetrieverConfig`). The relevant fields, with their defaults:

```yaml
db:
  uri: ./proc_demo.db   # Milvus Lite file, or a Standalone server e.g. http://localhost:19530
  name: my_db
collection_name: my_docs
jobs_per_gpu: 1         # upload jobs processed per GPU at once
max_queue_size: null    # pending-job cap
```

#### 2. Run the server

To start the server, run this command:

```bash
python3 -m mmore index-api --config-file /path/to/config.yaml --host the_host --port the_port
```

This command:

- starts the Uvicorn ASGI server on the specified host and port
- loads the FastAPI application from `src/mmore/run_index_api.py`

```{warning}
Keep this terminal window open. The backend runs in the foreground, and closing the terminal will shut it down.
```

#### 3. Concurrency and database

Uploads are processed by a background queue, one job per GPU (GPUs are auto-detected).
Two config fields tune this:

- `jobs_per_gpu` (default `1`): jobs processed per GPU at once. Total workers = GPUs * `jobs_per_gpu`.
- `max_queue_size` (default `null` = `num_gpu` * `jobs_per_gpu` * 10): pending-job cap, uploads beyond it get `503` http error.

```{note}
For `jobs_per_gpu > 1`, prefer a **Milvus Standalone** server
(`db.uri: http://localhost:19530`) over Milvus Lite. Milvus Standalone is better
suited to a production environment with concurrent load. Lite is fine for small or
local use. Keep `jobs_per_gpu: 1` with Lite.
```


## 📂 API Usage

### Upload endpoints

#### ▶️ `POST /v1/files`

**Upload a single file**

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `fileId` | `str` (form) | Unique identifier for the file |
| `file` | `UploadFile` (form) | File content to upload |
- rejects duplicate IDs with `409`
- queues a background job, returns `202` with a `jobId`

**Response** (`202 Accepted`):

```json
{
  "jobId": "a1b2c3d4...",
  "fileId": "example123"
}
```


#### ▶️ `POST /v1/files/bulk`

**Upload multiple files with IDs**

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `listIds` | `List[str]` (form) | Comma-separated list of file IDs |
| `files` | `List[UploadFile]` (form) | Files to upload |
- validates 1-to-1 correspondence between files and IDs
- queues **one independent job per file**, a bad file does not fail the batch

**Response** (`202 Accepted`):

```json
{
  "jobs": [
    {"fileId": "doc1", "jobId": "a1b2c3..."},
    {"fileId": "doc2", "error": "already exists"}
  ]
}
```


### 🔁 Update Endpoint

#### ✏️ `PUT /v1/files/{fileId}`

**Replace an existing file and re-index**

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `fileId` | `str` (path) | Existing file ID |
| `file` | `UploadFile` (form) | New file to replace with |
- queues a background job, returns `202` with a `jobId`
- old vectors are replaced only after the new content is processed (no data loss on failure)

**Response** (`202 Accepted`):

```json
{
  "jobId": "a1b2c3d4...",
  "fileId": "doc123"
}
```


### 🗑️ Delete endpoint

#### ❌ `DELETE /v1/files/{fileId}`

**Delete a file and remove its vector entry**

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `fileId` | `str` (path) | ID of the file to delete |
- deletes both local file and vector DB entry.

**Response**:

```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "message": "File successfully deleted",
  "fileId": "doc123"
}
```


### 📥 Download endpoint

#### 📄 `GET /v1/files/{fileId}`

**Download a file by its ID**

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `fileId` | `str` (path) | ID of the file to download |

Returns the file with binary content.

### 🛰️ Job status endpoints

Uploads return a `jobId`. Track it with either endpoint:

#### 📊 `GET /v1/jobs/{jobId}`

One-shot status snapshot. Returns `404` if the job is unknown (e.g. expired).

```json
{
  "jobId": "a1b2c3...", "fileId": "doc1", "filename": "doc.pdf",
  "status": "done", "device": "cuda:0",
  "result": {"chunks": 12}, "error": null
}
```

`status` is one of `queued`, `processing`, `done`, `failed`.

#### 📡 `GET /v1/jobs/{jobId}/events`

Server-Sent Events stream. The server pushes each status change and closes when
the job is `done` or `failed`, so the client does not poll. Example with `curl`:

```bash
curl -N http://host:port/v1/jobs/a1b2c3.../events
```

```{note}
Job status is kept in memory and dropped a couple of hours after the job ends
(and on restart). The durable record of an indexed document is its presence in
the collection, not the `jobId`.
```

## 🔄 How it works

1. **Upload** → bytes are saved, a background job is queued, `202` + `jobId` returns at once
2. **Process** (on the job's assigned GPU) → the file is processed
   1. **Crawling**: files are parsed using `Crawler`
   2. **Dispatching**: files are dispatched to the proper processor using `Dispatcher`
   3. **Processing**: text, images, and metadata are extracted and returned as a `MultiModalSample`
3. **Indexing** → dense and sparse vectors are stored in Milvus
4. The permanent file copy is saved only after indexing succeeds, then the job is marked `done`

## 🧰 Developer notes

- vector database: **Milvus** via `pymilvus`.
- default embedding models:
    - dense: `sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2`
    - sparse: `splade`
- supported file types:

```text
.pdf, .docx, .pptx, .md, .txt, .xlsx, .xls, .csv, .mp4, .avi, .mov, .mkv, .mp3, .wav, .aac, .eml, .html, .htm
```
    

### 💡 Tips

- avoid duplicate `fileId` unless you are intentionally updating a file with `PUT`
- you can test endpoints via Swagger UI at `/docs`
